# Branch name from Jira issue

A Chrome extension to generate a git branch name from a Jira issue.

TODO: add a description and sample use cases, as well as prerequisites and restrictions.

## Development
Start in development mode using `npm start`. This will launch webpack in watch mode, so that every change will be re-built on the fly and available in Chrome

This extension is inspired by JIRA Issue Branch Name Generator

For some reason that extension is not working with my company's Jira setup (e.g. we don't have URL in the form).
That's why I decided to create this extension, hoping it can be helpful for someone.
